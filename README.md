## Our primary tree split was based on town and then provider type
## This primarily reflected smaller towns with  few providers, which captured a good proportion of the fraud
## A second major split was on state, with certain states accounting for a greater percentage of the fraud, particularly, Florida, ## North Carolina, Montana, and Colorado

## Our results could be improved by creating a specialty level model of doctor with prescribing habits indicated as ratios of overall prescriptions.
